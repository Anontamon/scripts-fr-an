scripts-fr-an
=============

Addons to support additional writing system (scripts) on Android Firefox. The Android platform has 
limited font support with a range of African and South East Asian languages having limited or no support.
It is possible for web developers to specify which fonts to use on their websites. But on large sites 
where any language could be used, it is not practical to support individual languages effectively. 
It is necessary to use font fallbacks.

The addons in the scripts-fr-an project provide The Android Firefox with fallback fonts for scripts 
that Android does not support.
